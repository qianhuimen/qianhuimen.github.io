### Welcome!
<b>About me:</b> I am a Lecturer (Assistant Prof.) working in the field of computer vision for digital health in the School of Engineering Mathematics and Technology, University of Bristol. I am also a visiting researcher at University of Oxford. Before joining Bristol, I was a postdoctoral researcher in <a href="https://eng.ox.ac.uk/biomedical-image-analysis/noble-group/">Prof. Alison Noble's group<a> in University of Oxford, working on the projects <a href="https://eng.ox.ac.uk/pulse/">PULSE</a> and Turing AI WLR Fellowship. I received my Ph.D. degree in the Department of Computer Science from City University of Hong Kong, supervised by <a href="https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~howard/brief-bio.html">Prof. Howard Leung</a>. I was also a visiting student in <a href="http://hubertshum.com/">Prof Hubert P. H. Shum's</a> and <a href="https://www.edho.net/">Prof. Edmond S. L. Ho's</a> groups. I obtained my M.S. degree in the Department of Mathematics from National University of Singapore, and my B.S. degree in the School of Mathematical Sciences from Dalian University of Technology.

<b>Research Interests:</b> My research focuses on multimodal AI for healthcare decision-making, with two key areas of emphasis: 1) developing AI-driven human action and mobility assessment systems that integrate multimodal data (e.g. RGB/video inputs, 3D skeletal information, and wearable sensor data) to analyze and monitor patients with mobility challenges. The goal is to create robust AI models capable of accurately interpreting human movement across various human-centered informatics. 2) Trustworthy multimodal AI to enhance clinical decision support by integrating medical imaging, screening data, medical text reports, and real-time monitoring devices. This research aims to assist radiologists and clinicians in identifying and diagnosing diseases with greater accuracy and efficiency, while also enhancing their confidence in their assessments.
